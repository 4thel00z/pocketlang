[ ] Resolve function name (called before defined).

[ ] Structs.
[ ] Implement math library.
[ ] Implement resolve path in cli.
[ ] Single header for embedding.

    Then remove vm's root script.
[ ] C Integration api (including add core lib from host application).
[ ] REPL.
    [ ] compile expression for a script.

[ ] Function docstring property.
[ ] Union tagging alter in var.
[ ] (future) add structs and maybe enums.

// Bugs.
It's at pre-alpha and every thing is left to
